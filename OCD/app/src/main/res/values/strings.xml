It involves systematically exposing individuals to anxiety triggers while simultaneously preventing the accompanying compulsive responses.

ERP operates on the principle of breaking the cycle of obsessions and compulsions. By gradually exposing individuals to their anxiety triggers in a controlled manner and preventing the usual compulsive behaviors, it helps desensitize them to the distressing thoughts, fostering adaptive responses.</string>
